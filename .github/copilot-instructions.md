## Project Overview
This is a modern, recruiter-friendly developer portfolio built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The portfolio should be simple, clean, and showcase the developer's skills effectively.

## Key Guidelines

- Follow modern React patterns with hooks and functional components
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with a focus on responsive design
- Implement clean, semantic HTML structure
- Ensure accessibility best practices (proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Create reusable components in the `src/components` directory
- Use Next.js App Router for routing
- Implement smooth animations and transitions using Tailwind CSS or Framer Motion
- Follow a mobile-first responsive design approach

The portfolio should include these main sections:
1. **Hero/Landing** - Professional introduction with name, title, and brief tagline

3. **Skills** - Technical skills with visual representation
4. **Experience** - Work history and achievements
5. **Projects** - Showcase of best work with descriptions, tech stacks, and links
6. **Contact** - Professional contact information and social links

## Code Style

- Prefer functional components over class components
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props and data structures
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
